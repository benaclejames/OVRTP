# üëç OVRThumbParams
OVRThumbParams is an OpenVR Application that sends the currently touched controller face button over OSC. This can allow for greater dexterity for people using Sign Language in Social VR games such as VRChat.

## üíæ Installation

Simple! Run the installation .exe file in the releases. This will install the program as well as register it with OpenVR so it gets automatically launched.

## üõ† Avatar Setup

If you're here with the intention to use this mod for sign language, I reccomend checking out [ShiroXOkami' Guide](https://github.com/ShiroXOkami/ASL-Gestures-Simplified) for ASL gestures before reading this.

Now here's the part that can be tricky for some users. The mod simply reads the "touching" state of all Index controller face buttons and outputs them to two avatar params of "int" type.
You'll need to add these **case-sensitive** parameters to your avatar's base parameters:

* RightThumb
* LeftThumb

The mod will set these parameters with an integer from 0-4 representing the position of each thumb.

| Value | Real Position |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 0     | Not Touching  |
| 1     | A Button      |
| 2     | B Button      |
| 3     | Trackpad      |
| 4     | Thumbstick    |

Additionally, bool versions of the thumb positions are available to save on parameter space. They're mapped as:

* \[Left/Right]AButton
* \[Left/Right]BButton
* \[Left/Right]TrackPad
* \[Left/Right]ThumbStick

A special bool is also available to detect if the thumb is on either the A or B buttons. This is useful
on the Valve Index since generally when your thumb is resting in that area, both are being touched.

* \[Left/Right]ABButtons

From these, you're free to modify and/or play animations from your animation controllers however you wish!
